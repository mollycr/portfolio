  "summary": "While at Ten-X, I designed an iPhone app for real-estate investors who buy properties at our in-person foreclosure auctions.",

      "text": ["Ten-X sells foreclosed houses as Auction.com in two different ways: online auctions and in-person (or “third-party sale”, Auction.com being the third party) auctions. During the first stage of foreclosure you legally have to sell the property in a “public” space, and since Florida is the only state to recognise the internet as public for this purpose, houses are sold at ballroom or courthouse auctions. What makes these auctions difficult is that we don’t always know which houses can be sold until the morning of the auction: homeowners can contest foreclosure right up until it comes to the auction block, and the bank has to send an official approval before we can auction a property. So the list of auctionable houses will change even while the auction is taking place.",
      "It’s worth mentioning that this project was a little… weird. There were some political issues going on in the background, and Ten-X was short on user researchers while I was there, so a lot of decisions that should have been made based on user research were made based on expert opinion."]},
    {"subtitle": "Bingo Board",
      "imgs": ["img/auctionPal/bingoboard.jpg"],
      "text": ["Previously we managed this with a “bingo board:” a huge PowerPoint slide that updated automatically from our backend, that referenced ID numbers for houses that were on a huge printed list that all attendees received.",
      "To find out if the house that you want to buy is being auctioned that day, you have to drive to the auction site, get a list, find the property that you’re interested in, and sit watching the bingo board until you see the ID number that you’re looking for. Or don’t, because once houses are confirmed as postponed or not for sale, we completely remove the entry from the bingo board. It’s not marked as postponed or cancelled, it’s just gone.",
      "So the Mobile team and I started working on a concept for an app for third-party sale (TPS) auction-goers to notify them ahead of time whether or not houses that they’re interested in will be up at a particular auction."]},

      "text": ["I was brought onto this project about two weeks before a trip to one of the large ballroom auctions in Irvine to design and prototype a rough draft of this app to put in front of auction-goers and get some early feedback.",
        "We spoke to a few users at the auction, but weren’t able to get very much in-depth feedback due to the high-energy event and their (understandably) guarded nature going into an auction. I mean, people literally had envelopes with millions of dollars in cashier's checks with them. Which was really cool, but not conducive to getting much user research information. We did learn that these people are hurried and guarded, could benefit from additional technological support, and, on its face, were interested in the app."]},

      "text": ["At this point we identified personas and what features they would all need, so we could then decide which personas to target and which features to flesh out fully.",
        "After talking to the business and developing these personas, we decided to target the Investor. He represents the largest portion of our user base, and ___",
        "One of our main questions around search and discovery is whether investors tend to identify a property that they’re interested first and then figure out what auctions to go to based on that, or whether they identify an auction that they can attend and then look at the houses that will be sold. The answer turned out to be both/either: since investors generally can’t be sure if a property will go to auction or not and competition is fierce for these properties, they tend to go to every possible auction and look at every house. Investors don’t buy houses like owner/occupants, they care about numbers way more than pictures."]},
